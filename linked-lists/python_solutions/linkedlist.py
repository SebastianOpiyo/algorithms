# Descr: Implementing linked lists in python

# A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF LINKED LISTS.
# ---------------------------------
"""
* Linked lists is a common data structure that takes advantage of the embedded references.
* Linked lists are made up of nodes, each containing a ref to the next node in the list
* Each node contains a unit of data called the cargo
* It is considered a recursive data structure bcs it has recursive def.
* An empty linked list is represented by a  NONE
* It has a HEAD and a tail that points to NONE.
*
* WHY DO WE NEED LINKED LISTS?
* 1. They provide a way to assemble objects into a single entity i.e a collection

* To link the nodes we have to call next.
