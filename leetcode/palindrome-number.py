"""Given an integer x, return true if x is a

, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

 

Constraints:

    -231 <= x <= 231 - 1

 
Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?"""

        Numbers ending with zero cannot be palindromes (unless the number is exactly zero).
        This is because reversing them would produce a number with leading zeros, which are dropped in integers.
        So the check is a quick early exit to improve correctness and efficiency.
